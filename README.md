# ReputronZ
 ReputronZ is a parallel rewrite of a Discord Bot, written by [YorkAARGH](https://github.com/YorkAARGH/) and I, based on features from a bot written by Discord user Gus#0291, designed to give users the ability to contribute to eachother's reputation -- either positively or negatively -- creating a feedback system for user actions.


The original Reputron can be found [here](https://github.com/YorkAARGH/Reputron).


I began writing this alongside my contributions to the original project to challenge myself to finish before [YorkAARGH](https://github.com/YorkAARGH/), to use a different persistent storage method, to have a version of the bot written using my Discord.js Bot Library, and because I needed something to occupy me the day I started working on it while my wife was at work.


#Adding to a server
ReputronZ can be added to a server by clicking [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=227074700453478401&scope=bot&permissions=0). However, it should be noted that it's currently personally hosted on a pretty unreliable connection. I hope to rectify this soon. Uptime may also be iffy until I get my bots moved to my dedicated server as well which I have yet to set up since moving to my new home.
